//Goal: User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team. 

//create variables for the apps dependancies

//propt the user to build an engineering team.
  //team consists of a single manager and any number of engineers and inters

// Team members' name (perhaps click the team members name to go to their git hub)
// Prompt for member's EE ID#
// different questions an intern vs a manager vs an engineer
// Team members' email address (hyperlinked)
// Team members' github URL(hyperlinked)
// Need a method to check if the user is a manager??

// No limit to the number of team members that can be input
// three types of team members




//Manager Class
 //extends employee
 //office number what about name
 //getRole() overridden to return Manager
 

//Engineer Class

  //getRole() Overridden to return Intern

//generate a team HTML in the output directory
  //display a team roster
  //each team member must have 
    //name
    //role
    //id
    //role specific property (office #, github profile, office number)







//1. npm run test
//2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
//3. Repeat

// make methods simple so they are easy to test
//
