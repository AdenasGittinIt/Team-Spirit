//Goal: User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team. 

//Prompt user for information about the team manager and then the rest of the team

// first prompt the user then reder or apend to the page




  //Enter a team member's first and last name to get started.
  //what is this team member's role? 
    //instantiate a new Mngr, Engnr or Intern based on response 
    //what is name?
    //what is id#
    //what is email?

  //Would you like to add another team member?
      //if true prompt for the next team member
      //else render html

  //The user should not be allowed to add multiple managers to a sigle team. 

//save the responses to new instance of a manager, engineer or intern

//the class shouldn't be instantiated until after the user has completed the prompts.

//the html should not be rendered or created until after the user has entered all team members.
 //I can create the HTML with the first instance and then append 





// Team members' name (perhaps click the team members name to go to their git hub)
// Prompt for member's EE ID#
// different questions an intern vs a manager vs an engineer
// Team members' email address (hyperlinked)
// Team members' github URL(hyperlinked)
// Need a method to check if the user is a manager??

// No limit to the number of team members that can be input
// three types of team members

    //name
    //role
    //id
    //role specific property (office #, github profile, office number)







//1. npm run test
//2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
//3. Repeat
